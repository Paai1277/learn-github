# Frontend Framework Recommendations for Mobile Web App

Based on your current PHP/MySQL application and requirements for a responsive mobile web app that can be demonstrated on tablets, here are my recommendations:

## Frontend Framework Options

### 1. Bootstrap 5
**Recommended for quick implementation**
- Easy integration with your existing PHP codebase
- Built-in responsive grid system and mobile-first approach
- Good Thai language support
- Simple learning curve if you're already familiar with HTML/CSS

### 2. Vue.js
**Recommended for more interactive UI**
- Can be progressively integrated into your existing application
- Lightweight and performs well on mobile devices
- Excellent for creating reactive UI components
- Works well with your existing PHP backend through API calls

### 3. Ionic Framework
**If you want a more app-like experience**
- Creates web apps that look and feel like native mobile apps
- Excellent on both Android (Realme) and iOS (iPad) devices
- Can still work with your PHP backend through API calls

## Database Recommendation

Your current MySQL setup is perfectly suitable. No need to change databases, as:
- It's already integrated with your PHP codebase
- It handles your current data structure well
- It's sufficient for the scale of your price table application

## Local Demo Setup

To demonstrate on tablets:
1. Configure MAMP to accept connections from your local network:
   - Set Apache to listen on your computer's IP instead of just localhost
   - Update MAMP's ports if needed

2. For testing on tablets:
   - Connect tablets to the same WiFi network as your computer
   - Access your app via `http://[your-computer-ip]:[port]/price_table_copy.php?id_table=1`

3. Add viewport meta tags and responsive CSS for optimal mobile display:
   ```css
   /* Add this to your css/price_table.css file */
   @media (max-width: 768px) {
     .table-container {
       overflow-x: auto;
     }
     .container {
       width: 100%;
       padding: 10px;
     }
   }
   ```

Would you like me to provide more specific implementation details for any of these options?
